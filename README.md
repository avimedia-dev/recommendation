# Product Recommendation System

## Description

This project uses the results of an association analysis algorithm to generate product recommendations based on 7500 transactions. The recommendation rules are created from transaction data and are applied using association rules. The system provides a Flask web application where users can see product recommendations for a given product.

The project demonstrates how to use association rules to build a recommendation system, with a simple web interface for interacting with the model.

### Model Details

The recommendation system uses the results of association rule mining, which was applied to a dataset of 7500 transactions. The rules generated from the dataset are used to recommend products to customers based on the product they are currently viewing.

### Modeling Code

The code for generating the association rules and training the model can be found [here](https://github.com/avimedia-dev/data-analytics/blob/main/association_analysis.ipynb). It includes the steps for data preparation, rule generation, and exporting the rules for use in the Flask web application.

## Installation Instructions

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avimedia-dev/recommendation.git
cd recommendation

```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of the project:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

```

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate

```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

requirements.txt should include the necessary packages for the project, such as Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, and any other libraries required for running the recommendation system.

Example requirements.txt:

makefile
Copy code
Flask==2.1.1
pandas==1.4.2
scikit-learn==1.0.2
matplotlib==3.5.1
seaborn==0.11.2

### Step 4: Run the Flask Application

Once the dependencies are installed, run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py

```

This will start the Flask server, and you can access the web application at:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

```

### Step 5: Access the Application

In your web browser, open the URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/. The home page will show all available products, and clicking on a product will display recommendations for what else you can buy with that product.

## Project Structure

app.py: The main Flask application file where the server is initialized and routes are defined.
templates/: Contains HTML files for rendering the web pages.
index.html: The main page displaying all products.
product.html: The page displaying details for each product and its recommendations.
requirements.txt: The list of dependencies required to run the project.
models/: Contains the model and recommendation rules generated by the association analysis.

## Additional Information

This system assumes that the association rules are pre-generated and stored in a dictionary or similar structure. The model code can be found here for generating these rules.
You can customize the recommendation logic and user interface to meet your needs.
